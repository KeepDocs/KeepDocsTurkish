# Node Installation

You can support the Keep Network, participate and earn rewards by operating following node types:
   * Random Beacon Operator to randomly create groups of Signers for New Keeps
   * ECDSA Operator to sign Keeps and support the BTC -> tBTC Supply Peg

Right now Keep Network and tBTC system is running on Ropsten Testnet.
There are some very good guides to help you in the process of deploying both Nodes.

In general, the installation always includes the same steps:
- Create an [Infura](https://infura.io/) account and project (avoids running your own local Ethereum client, which is pretty big).
- Create an Ethereum wallet, e.g. My Ether Wallet with a keystore which you then import to Metamask.
- Authorize the Keep contracts on the appropriate Keep dashboard (testnet now, mainnet later), get some testnet KEEP and ETH, and delegate ETH using the dashboard.
- Get a Virtual Private Server (Amazon, Google Cloud, Azure, Vultr, Digital Ocean, Linode, and many others or even your own self-hosted server) running Ubuntu, install Docker.
- Deploy Keep nodes.

The guides have some differences relating to where to install, which steps are thorougly explained and if there is more or less automation in the deployment involved. It's up to your choice and if you have difficulties you can always head to the Keep discord channel, where you can find most guide authors and further help.

?> This [Keep Tools Guide](https://keeptools.org/) allows to generate some of the files necessary for the deployment and includes some [Docker Commands](https://keeptools.org/docker-commands) that help with managing Docker.

## Official Keep Network's System Considerations for Random Beacon Node
You can find the official **Run Random Beacon** documentation from Keep Network [here](https://docs.keep.network/run-random-beacon.html).
It's really technical thorough explanation of the node setup, but it's not meant for newbies. However there are some System Considerations, which are important to keep in mind :
> The Keep Network expects certain capabilites for each node running on the network. To help attain these capabilities consider the following criteria:

> - It is paramount that Keep nodes remain available to the Keep Network. We strongly encourage a stable and redundant internet connection.
> - A connection to a production grade self-hosted or third party Ethereum node deployment.
> - Persistent and redundant storage that will survive a VM or container rotation, and disk failure.
> - Each random beacon client running on the network requires a unique Ethereum operator account.
> - Each random beacon client running on the network requires a unique IP address or a unique application port running under the same IP.


## Absolute Beginner Guides

- **Nick Grego's** [Step-by-step guide for installing both ECDSA & Beacon Keep Network nodes on VPS with 100$ voucher](https://medium.com/@nickgrego/step-by-step-guide-for-installing-both-ecdsa-beacon-nodes-on-vps-with-100-voucher-db930ab2a667)
> This is step by step tutorial for newcomers to launch their first nodes in Keep Network with completely free VPS server and with minimal use of command line. To avoid any sort of errors, we would use the most user-friendly instruments to successfully complete this task fast and without any kind of mistakes.

Nick's guide (Gregory#6997 in Discord) has screenshots for every step involved and even the log examples where you can assure everything is running just fine.

- **Ben Longstaff's** [A beginners quick start guide to staking on the Keep Network testnet using DigitalOcean](https://medium.com/@ben_longstaff/a-beginners-quick-start-guide-to-staking-on-the-keep-network-testnet-using-digitalocean-5a74ca60adc3)

The other well known Beginner Guide, also with easy to follow screenshots explanations of every step.

- **JackRemix'** [The absolute beginner’s guide to Playing for Keeps](https://medium.com/@jack.baldwin/the-absolute-beginners-guide-to-playing-for-keeps-aea9ab32f6e8) is a newer **really impressive** guide, with every step well explained !

## Other Guides

- **Alex Novy's** [Run Random Beacon in KEEP Network Testnet](https://medium.com/@novysf/run-a-keep-network-testnet-node-37096946af35)

For this guide you should have already hired an VPS.

- **Chris Projecttent's** [Deploy a Random Beacon Node on the Keep Testnet](https://medium.com/@projecttent/deploy-a-random-beacon-node-on-the-keep-testnet-6c95d742fa5a) and [Deploy a Keep ECDSA Node on the Keep Testnet](https://medium.com/@projecttent/deploy-a-keep-ecdsa-node-on-the-keep-testnet-13f374b0c11a).

In his excellent guides, Chris relies on deploying a local Ethereum Client, so hardware requirements are a little bit higher than the others, but on the upside you don't need an Infura account. 

- **Afmsavage's** [Keep Ecdsa Node](https://gist.github.com/afmsavage/8fc19937a6b263f05c3e215d8860629c).

Afmsavage, aka Pantsme#2124 on Discord, developed this guide as a walkthrough to create Keep-ECDSA node for either mainnet or testnet, very handy to spot main differences between both deployments. It asumes that you already have your prep work done, meaning VPS running Linux, Infura, Wallet and Grant/Authorization steps fulfilled.

- **Papyasha's** [Deploy Edcsa and Random Beacon Nodes](https://gist.github.com/papyasha/49925cf882545dada27b3f3fb7f48304).

It asumes that you already have your prep work done, meaning VPS running Linux, Infura, Wallet and Grant/Authorization steps fulfilled.

## ECDSA Node on Amazon

- **Afmsavage's** [KEEP-ECDSA Node Terraform for AWS](https://github.com/afmsavage/keep-ecdsa-tf/tree/testnet). It goes through an Amazon setup, which comes with native email alerts for your node status.

## Script based Guides
Scripts help automating step by step process to setup ECDSA Node in Server. However you should already have your prep work done.

- **Jeremyid's** [Easy Keep Nodes](https://github.com/jeremyid/easy-keep-nodes). Experience#2376 did really easy scripts for both node setups.

- **Crypto Enthu's** [Keep Network — ECDSA Node Setup Guide](https://medium.com/@cryptoenthu1/keep-network-ecdsa-node-setup-5164b7c2cec3) and his [Repo](https://github.com/cryptoenthu1/keep-ecdsa-repo) by Naga#0916.

- **Finally-get-it's** Scripts for [Random Beacon](https://github.com/finally-get-it/keep-rb-repo) and [Edcsa Node](https://github.com/finally-get-it/keep-ecdsa-repo) by Ingag#8096. These guides/repos are based on Crypto Enthu's one, allowing project name and port changes.

- **DaniellMesquita's** [Keep Bot Node Installation Script](https://github.com/DaniellMesquita/keepbot), as he says: Absurdly easy script for setting up your KEEP Network and tBTC nodes.

## Kubernetes Installation Guide for ECDSA Node
Deploying on a Kubernetes cluster allows for redundancy to improve the reliability of a Production System. If a node goes down, a back up will be spun up to take its place.
Alex Crowe has written this excellent guide to deploy an ECDSA Node to Kubernetes, including the [Helm Charts](https://github.com/ajcrowe/keep-helm-chart) and the Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana.
[Deploy a KEEP Node to Kubernetes and Monitor with Prometheus & Grafana](https://medium.com/@alex.j.crowe/deploy-a-keep-node-to-kubernetes-and-monitor-with-prometheus-grafana-4ee5c7d9e9a4)


## Video Walkthrough

-**Bakarapara's** [Video walkthrough of Alex Novy's Guide](https://youtu.be/7zgXxqnYF_0). No sound, all images. Easy to follow.

## Keep Nodes on local Windows Machine

- [Running an ECDSA Keep locally hosted, testnet node on Windows for noobs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hsI8AtUiGAfcHxik-3akSRjysC0Zw0CVmHxmbNtZyHI/edit#). It might have some data (contracts and peers) outdated. But useful if you want to do some tests on a local pc.
