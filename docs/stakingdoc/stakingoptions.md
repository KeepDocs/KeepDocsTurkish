# Staking 101
The Keep Network is a proof of stake system. In order to earn rewards, you must participate in the network by staking KEEP tokens and validating the network.
## Overview
There are two ways to participate as a staker: you can stake KEEP tokens and run the Random Beacon client, or stake KEEP and bond ETH running the t-ECDSA client (the tBTC system). You can also elect to do both.

Firstly, you'll need to delegate KEEP tokens. You’ll be able to delegate both locked and unlocked KEEP to a staking address or a staking provider immediately after receiving your token grant. A token grant contains KEEP tokens that unlock at a set schedule over a period of time.
## Ways to Stake
### Staking with a Provider
Many of you are already set up with a staking provider through other networks you stake for. We’re happy to work with your preferred providers, but we have Figment, Staked, Bison Trails, and Blockdaemon already set up on testnet and prepared to work with clients. 
- Figment Networks, Yannik Folla (yannick@figment.network) 
- Staked, Tim Ogilvie (togilvie@staked.us)
- Bison Trails, Viktor Bunin (viktor@bisontrails.co)
- Blockdaemon, Konstantin Richter (konstantin@blockdaemon.com) 


Please reach out to your staking provider rep and they’ll start to get you onboarded, and let us know if you need recommendations or introductions.


### Staking In-House
If you’re staking in-house, you should running one or both nodes.

The **Node Operation Section** includes all support documentation in order to :

- [Deploy your Nodes](Node-Operation/deploy.md)
- [Manage your Nodes](Node-Operation/manage.md)
- [Troubleshooting](Node-Operation/troubleshooting.md)
- [Monitoring and Remote Alerting](Node-Operation/monitoring.md)
- [Risk Mitigation](Node-Operation/risks.md)

For further support, use Discord and see Keep Network's GitHub documentation.

### Using Keep Token dApp
The Keep Token Dashboard handles everything you’ll need to manage your token grants, staking delegation, and rewards. 
It let’s you: 
- Claim your token grants (in Testnet)
- Set up the different roles (authorizer, operator, beneficiary) for staking
- Delegate stake to an operator (staking provider) 
- Track and accept rewards
