# Staking Rewards
There are two kinds of staking rewards earned from either client (random beacon and t-ECDSA). The Keep Network has a non-inflationary rewards model, and all rewards are in KEEP, ETH and/or tBTC.
## Random Beacon Rewards
If you’re running the random beacon client and staking KEEP, you’ll earn a fee in ETH per each completed transaction. The fee is based on the gas cost to run the relay plus an additional fee (exact amount per relay still under consideration, it will be in the $10-50 USD range). 

In addition to the transaction fee, you’ll be earning a portion of the KEEP staking subsidy (2% of total KEEP over the course of the distribution period) for running the beacon.

## t-ECDSA/tBTC Rewards
If you’re running the t-ECDSA client and staking ETH, every completed transaction is a 6 month term (unless called to redeem earlier). The fees in the tBTC system start at 5 bps per Bitcoin deposit. 

tBTC stakers with ETH bonded will also earn a portion of the KEEP staking subsidy (18% of total KEEP over the course of the distribution period) for successfully participating in the network while staking ETH.
