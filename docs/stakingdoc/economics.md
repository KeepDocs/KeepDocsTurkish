# Staking Economics
In the beginning, tBTC is a two sided network with BTC and ETH stakers.
## Incentive Model
In the beginning, tBTC is a two sided network with BTC and ETH stakers. In order to incentivize ETH and good stakers, we put in place the following staking incentive model. tBTC signers who stake ETH will earn KEEP over 12-18 months, and initial Keep holders can stake for a pro-rata on the subsidy distribution.

## Public Stakedrop
The Keep stakedrop is a way for ether (ETH) holders to get involved as tBTC signers, helping bring Bitcoin to Ethereum. 

Any ETH holder can run a Keep node, and collect fees on their ETH while supporting Bitcoin on Ethereum.   

As the stakedrop progresses, ETH stakers will be granted KEEP based on their staking performance. 

As much as 18% of the total KEEP supply will be distributed during the drop.  The stakedrop will go on for ~6 months, until the total KEEP allocated to the drop is exhausted (estimated 12–18 months). After that point, all stakers will need to put down KEEP to participate.  

## KEEP Holders Stakedrop Subsidy
tBTC signers who stake KEEP and ETH early will earn ETH and tBTC rewards. Starting June 8th these stakers will immediately start earning KEEP as well, so these initial KEEP purchasers essentially earn a pro-rata on the subsidy distribution. 



Distribution graph for Keep and tBTC Signers during the "stakedrop"
This is the staking incentive distribution curve: 

For 12-18 months anyone backing a tBTC deposit with ETH will get KEEP on a distribution curve.

18% of the supply goes to tBTC backers. The other 2% goes to subsidize the random beacon.

Stakers who are prepared to bond ETH as tBTC launches will continue to capture more of the subsidy as tBTC signing opens up. The longer a staker is successful on the network, the more deposits they are able to handle in parallel. Additionally the likelihood of being chosen for a signer set depends on how much ETH is staked. 

## What does this look like? 

Assume 1% ownership of the Keep network & ETH staking immediately at launch.

The pro-rata allows the staker to take ~10% of the total KEEP subsidy (also tBTC fees).

Over the course of 12-18 months, 1% turns into 2.3% of the total network.

## Staking economics  - parameters to consider  

Before June 8th: 10% of KEEP staked means 10% of the chance for rewards. If you don't mess up, and you do the work, you get 10% of the rewards

After June 8th, until the stakedrop reward pool is emptied (roughly 12-18 months) there's a function that: 

 First makes sure tBTC has enough ETH 

Then chooses based first on KEEP holdings, all else being equal, 

 then based on ETH

So it's not quite "10% of ETH gets 10% of rewards", but I expect ETH-only will be much greater than "ETH bonded by KEEP stakers", so that could be approximately correct.
